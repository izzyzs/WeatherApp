# WeatherApp

### A Weather app created with the OpenWeatherMap API

#### I created weather application which uses an API provided by OpenWeatherMap to retrieve weather information based on the user's geolocation.

#### This project was an attempt to get my feet wet with regards to the use of external APIs in projects, and also setting up my own server, ableit a simple one, to handle the preparing and formatting of the data recieved from the OpenWeatherMap API.

#### Note: The user's latitude and longitude was recieved using IpInfo's API.

## Technologies Used
